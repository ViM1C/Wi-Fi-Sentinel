Wi-Fi Sentinel turns the $30 **M5Stack Cardputer** into a **self-contained Wi-Fi scanning and visualization tool**.  

Power it on, and it automatically scans nearby Wi-Fi networks, showing **real-time signal strength** with **color-coded indicators** on its built-in display â€” no PC or terminal required.

## âœ¨ Features  

- **Autonomous Scanning:** Boots and runs standalone â€” no external control needed.  
- **Color-Coded Dashboard:** Green = strong, Yellow = medium, Red = weak signals.  
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Auto-refresh cycles keep results up to date in real time.  
- **Portable Form Factor:** Runs on a compact ESP32-S3 microcontroller with limited resources.

## ðŸš€ Why It Matters  

Wi-Fi Sentinel isnâ€™t just a blinking demo â€” itâ€™s a showcase of:  

- **IoT & Embedded Programming** on constrained hardware  
- **Real-Time Wireless Reconnaissance** automation  
- **Data Visualization** in resource-limited environments  

Future enhancements could include **data logging, signal mapping, or security alerts** â€” turning it into a full wireless analysis toolkit.

## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started  

1. **Flash Firmware:** Install MicroPython or UIFlow2 on the M5Stack Cardputer.  
2. **Upload Script:** Copy the Wi-Fi Sentinel code using Thonny or ampy.  
3. **Run Standalone:** Power on the device â€” scanning starts automatically.

## ðŸ–¥ Quickstart Example  

```python
import network, time
from M5 import M5Screen

screen = M5Screen()
screen.clean_screen()
wifi = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
wifi.active(True)

while True:
    nets = wifi.scan()
    screen.print("Wi-Fi Networks:")
    for ssid, bssid, channel, rssi, auth, hidden in nets:
        color = "Green" if rssi > -60 else "Yellow" if rssi > -75 else "Red"
        screen.print(f"{ssid} | {rssi} dBm | {color}")
    time.sleep(5)
    screen.clean_screen()
```
